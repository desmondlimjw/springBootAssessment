# Spring Boot Assessment - Reflections

### What did you like about this project?
* Applying what we have learnt to create an everyday tool (at least for me) using a popular Java framework
* Enforcement of concepts = good form of revision 

### What did you struggle with in this project?
* In the itemController.java file, I had trouble parsing the target date as a date object. The program threw me an error saying it was receiving a String object, which prevented it from storing the entry in the database.
* Thankfully, came across an annotation "@DateTimeFormat(iso = DateTimeFormat.ISO.DATE)" which could be used to solve the problem. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40274353/how-to-use-localdatetime-requestparam-in-spring-i-get-failed-to-convert-string)  

### What would make your experience with this assessment better?
* It was a good experience overall.
